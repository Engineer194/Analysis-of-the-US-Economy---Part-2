# **Analysis of the US Economy - Part 2**

## **Introduction**

In the first part of this study, looking at the distribution of funds from the US budget, we did not see good prospects in the future. It is not invested in the development of the USA, but in the wars, their consequences and the interest on the loans taken. The share of interest payments on borrowed loans is also very large. The almost direct linear dependence of the expansion of the economy on inflation (printing money) and borrowing was also shown.

From here, we can ask ourselves the following question: Can we use ML to predict approximately when the US economy will go into recession? The second part of the present study will be based on the answer to this question.
