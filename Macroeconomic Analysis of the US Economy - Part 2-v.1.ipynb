    "\n",
    "In the **first part** of this study, looking at the distribution of funds from the US budget, we did not see good prospects in the future. It is not invested in the development of the USA, but in the wars, their consequences and the interest on the loans taken.\n",
    "The share of interest payments on borrowed loans is also very large. The almost direct linear dependence of the expansion of the economy on inflation (printing money) and borrowing was also shown. The latter, since the dollar is a world currency, means printing money again. As a result of all that has been said so far, we can safely summarize that the American economy is addicted to printing new money. The trade balance is strongly negative with a worsening trend. Science is not a priority. If for some reason the printing of new money stops and/or the dollars of the world go \"home\" to the USA, we are waiting for \"Great Depression - 2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can ask ourselves the following question: <a style=\"color:purple;\">**Can we use ML to predict approximately when the US economy will go into recession?**</a><br>The **second part** of the present study will be based on the answer to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **2 main theoretical assumptions** at play:<br>\n",
    "1. U.S. recessions exhibit markers / early warning signs.<br>\n",
    "There exist plenty of recession “signals” in the form of individual economic or market data series. While individually, these signals have limited information value, they may become more useful when combined together.\n",
    "2. Future recessions will be similar to historical recessions.<br>\n",
    "This assumption is a lot more shaky, but can be mitigated by choosing features that maintain significance despite the changing economic landscape. For example, focusing on manufacturing data may have been relevant historically, but may be less relevant going forward as the world goes digital."

    "### 2. **Preparing the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Criteria according to which the data for the present study were collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things I had to consider when getting the data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Economic data are released at different frequencies** (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.). To time-match data points, I settled for only using data that could be sampled monthly. As a result, all predictions must be conducted at a monthly frequency. This means that GDP data, as it comes out on a quarterly basis, will be approximated to a monthly basis.\n",
    " - **Varying data history lengths**. Some data has been released since 1919, while other data only goes back a few years. This means I had to exclude potentially useful data that just didn’t have enough history.\n",
    " - **Speaking of history**, I needed enough data to encompass as many recessions as I could. In the end, the full data set included 8 recessions since 1966.\n",
    " - **Economic data gets revised often**. FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) does not provide the original figures. It only provides the revised figures (no matter how far after-the-fact those revisions are made).\n",
    " - **Rare-event prediction**: Recessions are rare.\n",
    " - **Small data set**: Because I am using economic data (which is updated at a frequency of months or quarters), I will only have a few hundred data points to work with.\n",
    " - For practical reasons, I used mostly **public domain data** available through **[FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)** and **[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)**. I did not use potentially useful data that is stuck behind a paywall, such as [The Conference Board Leading Economic Index](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators)."

    "\r\n",
    "Some project-specific considerations for feature selection: <br> \r\n",
    "- **Curse of Dimensionality**. Since the data set is so small (only a few hundred data points), one cannot include too many features in the final model. Otherwise, the model will fail to generalize to out-of-sample data. Therefore, features must be carefully chosen for the incremental value that each feature provides.\r\n",
    "- **Domain knowledge is key**. Since the underlying process is a complex time series, automated feature selection methods have a high risk of over-fitting to prior data. Therefore, feature selection must be guided by a solid understanding of economic fundamentals."

    "The inclusion of Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the ML model for predicting recessions in the US economy can be justified in several ways:<br>\n",
    "**Economic Indicator:** GDP is one of the most important indicators of the health of the economy and is widely used to assess economic development. Changes in the value of GDP can be indicative of changes in economic activity and warn of an impending recession.<br>\n",
    "**Correlation with other factors:** GDP is correlated with many other economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, investment and consumption. Including GDP in the model can help capture these complex interactions and improve the predictive power of the model.<br>\n",
    "**Long-Term Trends:** Research shows that changes in the value of GDP can be harbingers of future economic recessions. Including this key indicator in the model can help detect long-term trends and cycles in the economy.<br>\n",
    "**Financial Market:** Investors often use GDP data to make investment decisions. GDP forecasts based on the ML model can be useful for investors in assessing risk and profit opportunities.\n",

    "The monthly unemployment rate is a key indicator of labor market conditions and can provide insights into the overall health of the economy. Rising unemployment rates can signal economic weakness and potential recessions.\n",

    "6. <a style=\"color:purple;\">**Slope of the yield curve**:</a><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of the yield curve, particularly the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, can provide insights into market expectations for future economic conditions. Inverted yield curves, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, have historically been a reliable predictor of recessions.\n",

Composite leading indicators are designed to provide early warnings of potential turning points in the business cycle. These indicators combine multiple economic variables to create a comprehensive measure of economic activity and can help to identify potential risks for the economy.\n",
